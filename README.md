# Tic Tac Toe

It's tic-tac-toe, in the terminal! I'd recommend using a dark theme for your terminal
for best viewing.

## Installation

### Using Cargo

1. Install `Rustup`: https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started
2. `cargo install tictacterminal`
3. Make sure your `..cargo/bin` folder is in your PATH
