# Tic Tac Terminal

It's tic-tac-toe, in the terminal! I'd recommend using a dark theme for your terminal
for best viewing.

## Installation

### Using Cargo

1. Install `Rustup`: https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started
2. `cargo install tictacterminal`
3. Make sure your `..cargo/bin` folder is in your PATH
4. Run `tictacterminal` in your terminal


### From Executable

1. Identify the appropriate executable for your OS from the latest release
2. Unzip (or Untar) it
3. Run the executable

_Note: The MacOS executable is not signed or notarized. You *can* get it to run, but I'd recommend using `rustup` instead._

## Play the Game

It's Tic-Tac-Toe... Use the arrow keys (or h/j/k/l) to move the cursor, `Enter` to choose your space. `Esc` to exit the game. [Play with a friend](https://tmate.io/)!
